                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  All services must be booked through our official platform. Full
                  payment is required upon confirmation unless pre-approved.
                  Additional fees may apply for extra services or unusual
                  conditions (e.g., excessive clutter, pet-related messes).

                  We require at least 24 hours' notice for cancellations or
                  rescheduling. Late cancellations (within 24 hours) may result in
                  a fee of up to 50% of the scheduled service. Repeated
                  short-notice cancellations may affect future booking
                  eligibility.

                  instructions are required, they must be shared in advance.
